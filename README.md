# RNAseq Survival Analysis for TCGA-KIRC

This repository is a fork of a post by "TriS" on Biostars.org entitled "Tutorial: Survival analysis of TCGA patients integrating gene expression (RNASeq) data" available at https://www.biostars.org/p/153013/

I think it will be very helpful for others to have a running example to learn off of. For demonstration purposes, I thought the nitty gritty parts about preprocessing the data were a little hard to follow and possibly detract from the main point of the tutorial. That being said, I went ahead and formatted the input data in a way that I think is a little easier to understand. Also, I have provided this data so that any additional changes to the source material does not change the results of the analysis as seems to be the case with the previous release of KIRC used in the Biostars post.
